## Install

1. Open  `ConEmu.xml`, usually located at `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\ConEmu.xml`.
2. Find the the key with the name `Colors`. If you don't have any custom color scheme, this key does not exists. In that case, go to **Settings** / **Feature** / **Colors** generate any custom color scheme and save it. At this point it doesn't matter what it is, as it will be overwritten.
